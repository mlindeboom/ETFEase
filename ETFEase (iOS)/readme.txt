The subitted iPhone app looks at 2 ETF trading strategies (RSI25 and R3) for the last 24 months. It will rank the list of ETFs alphabetically or on "growth of 10000 dollars" There are filters for ETF classification as well as buy and sell information.

The application I am submitting is a work in progress. The data load wait time is acceptable in the simulator but not in my ipod. Please be patient waiting for the data to load (or just use it in the simulator). 

The ETF tab is fully functional, data can be filtered and sorted. Selecting a cell will display a chart and trade history for the selected ETF. Two selectable trading strategies (R3 and RSI25) are available.
