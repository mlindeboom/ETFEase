An ETF tradng application based upon an ebook on "proven profitable algorthms". It is built as a tool for learning AppEngine, Android and iOS programming. 

The GoogleAppEngine service uses a list of etfs to query yahoo financials for data. The service also executes the filter algorithms used to recommend trades. 

The iOS and Android applications call the service and alert the device owner if there are any trade recommendations pending.

After writing the applications, I ran a live test, borrowing $2000.00 from my household account and following the recommended trades. As a tool for learning, it was invaluable. It was also very efficiant at losing money as $2000.00 became $700.00!
